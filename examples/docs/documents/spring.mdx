# Using with React Spring

## Using `react-spring`

Let's start by installing it:

```bash
npm install three @react-spring/three
```

We will need to import two things from `react-spring`

```js
import { useSpring, animated } from '@react-spring/three'
```

Let's go over them, shall we?

- `useSpring` - A hook to transform values into animated-values
- `animated` - A component that is used instead of your DOM or mesh, so instead of using mesh you will animated.mesh if you want it to be affected by react-spring


You can make Atom with animated value:
```js
import { Atom as _ } from 'react-mol'
const Atom = animated(_)
```

Let's create our first spring and attach it to our mesh when the user clicks.

```js
const { scale } = useSpring({ scale: active ? 1.5 : 1 })
```

Now that we have this animated value let's place it in our Instanced mesh:

```jsx
<Atom  scale={scale}/>
```
